## Introduction
Linux is an open-source operating system which is the first choice of every technocrat. For VLSI Design Engineers also most of the EDA tools are only compatible with Linux. In Linux, we interact with OS majorly with Command-Line Interface (CLI). In beginning, it might look a bit tedious as you have to remember lots of commands and we are addicted to GUI interface but later you will definitely love it.

## Purpose
Linux is used extensively by all of the semiconductor-specific companies for chip development and is a must-know skill for Analog and Digital Design Engineers. Hence, in this repository we will be using a Linux environment to design and simulate our Analog designs.

## Linux Commands
* Command to view all the folders and files in a specific location: “ `ls` ”
* Command to view all the last state or changes in the OS: “ ll ”
* Command to view all the last state or changes in the OS: “ ls -ltr ”
* Command to enter into a file or folder location: “ cd space file name ”
* Command to go back to the previous file or folder location: “ cd space .. ”
* Command to open a specific file: “ gvim space filename ”
