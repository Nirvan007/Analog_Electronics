## Tool Description
* The Cadence Virtuoso Layout Suite, part of the Virtuoso Studio, reinvents this industry-leading solution to create trusted analog, digital, and mixed-signal designs. While enabling the “More Than Moore” paradigm with heterogeneous integration, accelerated tool performance and differentiated productivity features enable faster integrated circuit (IC) design convergence with higher quality. Whether it’s device-level, cell-level, chip-level, or system-level design, Virtuoso Layout Suite provides advanced automation capabilities for collaboration, layout planning, placement, and routing with powerful in-design analysis and electrical awareness.
* Seamlessly integrated with the Virtuoso Schematic Editor and the Virtuoso Analog Design Environment, the Virtuoso Layout Suite enables the creation of quality artwork that is both fast and silicon accurate.

## Startup Procedure
* Start the Linux environment
* Open the CLI or Terminal using the applications menu
* Go to the Cadence Virtuoso workspace or work area directory, e.g.: `/project/amsworkspace/amslab68_workspace/virtuoso_wa`
* In the CLI (Terminal) window we have to give the tool's work area directory location, e.g.: `/project/amsworkspace/amslab68_workspace/virtuoso_wa`
* In the CLI (Terminal) window we have to give the source for the tool, type the command: “ `source bashrc` ”
  * NOTE: This command may be different for different versions/organizations
* In the CLI (Terminal) window we use this command to start the Cadence Virtuoso Tool: “ `virtuoso &` ”
  * Here `&` is used so that we can add more commands (adding processes) in the terminal while the tool command is running.
