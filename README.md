# Analog Electronics

Welcome to the Analog Electronic Simulations repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the practical aspects of analog electronic circuits and Analog VLSI design. It contains a collection of simulations, tutorials, circuits, and the theory related to analog circuits.

## Motivation
The main motivation behind this repository is to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the concepts of analog circuits and Analog VLSI design. Whether you are a student, hobbyist, or professional engineer, this repository aims to help you gain a deeper insight into the fascinating world of analog electronics.

## Contents
The repository is organized into separate folders for each simulation, making it easy to find specific topics of interest. Each folder contains the following:

* Theory: Detailed explanations of the fundamental concepts and principles related to the specific simulation.
* Circuits: Schematics and circuit diagrams are used in the simulations, allowing you to visualize the designs.
* Simulations: Simulation files and configurations are used to analyze and model the behavior of the analog circuits.
* Tutorials: Step-by-step guides and instructions on setting up and running the simulations.

## Prerequisites
To make the most of this repository, a basic understanding of electronics and analog circuit theory is recommended. Additionally, familiarity with simulation software like Cadence Virtuoso or SPICE (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) will be beneficial for running the simulations.

## Installation and Usage
To access the content in this repository, simply clone the repository to your local machine: 
git clone https://github.com/Nirvan007/Analog_Electronics.git

Each simulation folder contains individual README files with specific instructions on setting up the simulations and running them using the supported software.
